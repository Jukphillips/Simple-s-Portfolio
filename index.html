      <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p> Like I said before my name is Justin Phillips, but normally I just go by Simple Psychology on the internet. A couple things about me, I live Colorado Springs, Co and I have my entire life. Eventually 
            I plan to move somewhere else, but I can't see myself not making this place a permenant home. It's incredibly gorgeous and I know I've barely just scratched the surface.
            I just turned 19 which is neet. </br>
        </br> I decided to take this career path of being a Full-stack developer for a couple reason. 1. For the earning potential. I'm someone who wants to live an expensive lifestyle, and while full-stack wont 
            get me to level I want, its an important first step to investing. 2. Easy of entry. Employers in this field don't care if you went to college,
            at least most of them, so I don't to worry about wasting 4-8 years on a degree. Instead I can spend 3 months. 3. WIth the way covid has affected this industry
            it's future looks largely remote. That means I'll be able to travel or be anywhere in the world and still make a good living, without sacrficing important things in my life. 
        </br></br>
            
            My main hobbie is cars. I love fast and aggressive cars like the shelby gt500 or cadillac ct5-v blackwing. Other then that it's traveling and doing fun adventurous things with my girlfirend. 
            I think for now that's a good intro to me, now go check out my awesome portfolio!
